# Yoo, I'm Mage.Dev 👋

**Aspiring Cybersecurity Specialist (Offensive & Defensive) & AI/ML Engineer** building hands-on skills and a practical portfolio.  
I like breaking systems, figuring out how they tick, **detecting how they break**, and automating stuff through code.

## ⚡ What I’m Into
- **BlackArch Linux** — offensive security, pentesting & adversary labs  
- **Blue Team & Defense** — logs, detection, incident response mindset  
- **Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript** — exploits, tooling, automation & backend  
- **DSA** — thinking in algorithms, efficiency, and problem-solving  
- **Web & APIs** — attacking, securing, and understanding backend systems  
- **Machine Learning** — using AI for detection, automation, and smarter security

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools
Python | C/C++ | Java | JavaScript | Bash/Shell | SQL | Linux | DSA |  
BlackArch | APIs | ML | Pentesting | Defensive Security | Automation

## 🧠 Security Focus (Purple Team)
- **Offensive**: recon, exploitation, scripting, understanding attacker behavior  
- **Defensive**: detection logic, logs, system visibility, response thinking  
- **Mindset**: attack → detect → improve → repeat  

## 🚀 Projects / Highlights
- Cybersecurity scripts, **pentesting & defensive labs**, and automation tools  
- DSA solutions & algorithm practice in multiple languages  
- Small AI/ML projects integrating **security data, automation, and analysis**
